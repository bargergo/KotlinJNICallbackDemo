# KotlinJNICallbackDemo

This demo app demonstrates calling C++ functions from Kotlin and then calling Kotlin functions from C++.

Sound files are played using [Oboe library](https://github.com/google/oboe) version 1.3.0. The Kotlin functions `onMusicStarted` is called from C++ code when the first audio frame is rendered, and `onMusicEnded` is called when the last audio frame is rendered of the sound file. [See Player.cpp](https://github.com/bargergo/KotlinJNICallbackDemo/blob/master/app/src/main/cpp/audio/Player.cpp)
